# deprecated - ember-learn-search-components

This addon is deprecated. It was used in earlier versions of Ember's websites.
We created a shared component library which removed the need for this library.
It will still be available for public use via npm, but will not receive any further updates.
Please see [https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide)
instead. Thank you!

This addon was an addon that helped the Ember Learn Team share common search components between the various Ember apps used for various Ember websites.
